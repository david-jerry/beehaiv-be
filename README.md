# Beehaiv Backend Development

Beehaiv is a powerful backend framework designed for building scalable, secure, and efficient APIs using FastAPI. This project leverages advanced tools such as Pydantic, SQLModel, Redis, Celery, and PostgreSQL to provide a robust environment for backend development. Beehaiv is structured to operate as a standalone project for each user domain, ensuring data isolation, security, and maintainability.

## Overview

Beehaiv Backend is engineered for developers looking to build high-performance APIs with a modular approach. Each component is designed to handle a specific aspect of backend development, making it easier to extend, maintain, and deploy projects for various user domains.

### Core Technologies

-   **FastAPI**: Utilizes FastAPI for rapid development and high-performance APIs, featuring easy integration with Pydantic for data validation.
-   **Resend for Emails**: Implements a flexible solution for email resending, allowing integration with services such as Amazon SES or SendGrid for efficient email handling.
-   **Pydantic**: Employs Pydantic for data validation and schema definition, ensuring type safety and clear API contracts.
-   **SQLModel**: Uses SQLModel, an ORM that integrates SQLAlchemy and Pydantic for seamless database interactions with a focus on Python typing.
-   **Redis**: Incorporates Redis as an in-memory data store, enhancing application performance through caching, session management, and message brokering.
-   **Celery**: Leverages Celery for asynchronous task management, ideal for handling background processing and long-running tasks.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Adopts PostgreSQL for reliable, ACID-compliant data storage with advanced querying capabilities.
-   **User Domain Isolation**: Supports isolated, secure deployments for each user domain, facilitating multi-tenant architecture and personalized backend operations.

## Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.7+**: Ensure that you have Python installed with a compatible version.
-   **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pipenv fastapi pydantic sqlmodel redis celery[redis] psycopg2-binary
    ```

    _(Replace `psycopg2-binary` with the appropriate version if necessary.)_

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure that organizes components efficiently under the `src` directory for better scalability and management:

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beehaiv_backend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd beehaiv_backend
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    pipenv install
    ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store configuration variables.

2. Define essential configuration values in `.env`:

    ```plaintext
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
    # Email service configurations (e.g., SMTP settings)
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

## Development

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
./run_server.sh
```

You can access the interactive API documentation at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redocs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redocs).

## Running the Project

For production deployments, consider using a process manager such as Gunicorn or Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn src:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
